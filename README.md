# sheet Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template david-hodge/sheet
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

Three different coloured headers are pre-defined via 'tutorial', 'lab' and 'bonus' sheet types.

Template files for all three are available in the extension's template folder.
Or via

`quarto use template david-hodge/sheet/lab`

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [template.qmd](template.qmd).
