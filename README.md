# sheet Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template david-hodge/sheet
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

The extension can be loaded plain via `quarto add` but you will then need to get correct syntax. For first use definitely take the approach above to see what the templates look like.

## Using

Three different coloured headers are pre-defined via 'tutorial', 'lab' and 'bonus' sheet types.

## Guidance

There is a separate [guidance document](guide.md).

## Example

Here is the source code for a sample tutorial sheet: [tutorial.qmd](tutorial.qmd).
